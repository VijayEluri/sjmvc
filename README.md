Simple MVC framework for Java
=============================
       
SJMVC is a simple MVC framework for Java, that provides an easy
way to develop Java based web applications following common
best practices.

The intention of this framework is to keep things as simple as
possible. It relies on the JEE standard libraries, and it is up
to the developers to include third party libraries to extend the
core functionality.


Compiling SJMVC
---------------

SJMVC can be compiled as a standard [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) project:

That will run all tests and generate the packaged file in the *target/* folder.
